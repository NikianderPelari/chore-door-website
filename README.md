Website showing abilities in web development

Completed several online courses through codecademy on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

After taking the courses, I built the Chore Door game using HTML to structure it, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to make it dynamic.

It took me roughly a week to run through the courses and 8-10 hours to finish the project
